Monoflector
===========

Monoflector is an open source front-end for [Cecil Decompiler](https://github.com/mono/cecil/tree/master/decompiler). It allows you to reverse-engineer .Net assemblies into understandable code (e.g. C#). See the [Wiki](https://github.com/jcdickinson/Monoflector/wiki) for more information.

Currently it is only being built for the MSFT CLR, but extensibility/supplant points exists for Mono.

**Again, this isn't a Mono application, it's a Windows/MSFT CLR one.**

**NB:** Monoflector is just getting ramped up as a project. We're working on this as quickly as possible to get it to a day-to-day usable state. Thank you for all of the interest so far and for checking out the project. In the mean time, please stay tuned and keep an eye on the project. If you would like to get involved contact one of the contributors; although we can't promise anything yet as the codebase is not yet mature enough for a large amount of contributors.
